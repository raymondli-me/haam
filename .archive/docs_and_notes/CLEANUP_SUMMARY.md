# Codebase Cleanup Summary

Date: 2025-08-18

## What Was Done

### 1. Identified Orphan Files
Used the unified analyzer to identify 21 files with no import relationships (orphans).

### 2. Created Archive Structure
- Created `/archive/` directory with subdirectories for scripts, modules, and other files
- Added comprehensive README.md explaining the archived files

### 3. Moved Orphan Files
**Scripts moved to `/archive/scripts/`:**
- Codebase analyzers (7 files)
- Word cloud validity experiments (6 files)
- Other utilities

**Modules moved to `/archive/modules/`:**
- `haam_setup.py`
- `haam_usage_guide.py`
- `haam_visualizations_backup.py`
- `haam_wordcloud_backup.py`

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Removed references to archived modules from `docs/api/haam.rst`
- Deleted API documentation files for archived modules
- Rebuilt Sphinx documentation successfully

## Results

### Before Cleanup:
- 41 Python files
- 21 orphan files
- 20,391 lines of code
- Complex import structure with many disconnected files

### After Cleanup:
- 24 Python files (41% reduction)
- 4 orphan files (all legitimate: docs/conf.py, setup.py, analyzers)
- 10,813 lines of code (47% reduction)
- Clean, focused codebase structure

## Remaining Structure

### Core Package (`/haam/`):
- 6 connected modules providing main functionality
- All imports properly connected
- No backup files

### Examples (`/examples/`):
- 7 example scripts showing usage
- All import from main package

### Tests:
- 6 test files
- All connected to main package

### Documentation:
- Updated to reflect current structure
- API docs only show active modules
- Build completes with expected warnings about archived modules

## Next Steps

1. This cleanup is on the `cleanup-orphan-files` branch
2. Test that package still installs and functions correctly
3. Run test suite to ensure no functionality was broken
4. Merge to main branch when satisfied

## Notes

- All archived files are preserved in `/archive/` for reference
- The archive includes a README explaining each file's purpose
- No functional code was deleted - only orphaned utilities and backups
