# Analysis: Why No Dark Red/Blue Colors in Word Clouds

## Summary of Investigation

I've analyzed the `_calculate_topic_validity_colors` method in `/Users/raymondli701/workspace_2025_08_13/haam/haam/haam_wordcloud.py` and found the following:

## Current Color Assignment Logic

The method assigns colors based on topic validity measures:
- **Dark red (#8B0000)**: When n_high == 3 (Y, HU, and AI all in top quartile)
- **Light red (#FF6B6B)**: When n_high > 0 (at least one measure in top quartile)
- **Dark blue (#00008B)**: When n_low == 3 (Y, HU, and AI all in bottom quartile)
- **Light blue (#6B9AFF)**: When n_low > 0 (at least one measure in bottom quartile)
- **Dark grey (#4A4A4A)**: Mixed signals (both high and low)
- **Light grey (#B0B0B0)**: All measures in middle quartiles

## Potential Issues Identified

### 1. Fallback to Legacy Method
The method first checks if `self.criterion`, `self.human_judgment`, or `self.ai_judgment` are None. If any are missing, it falls back to `_calculate_topic_validity_colors_legacy`, which uses PC associations instead of topic validity measures.

**Debug Added**: The code now prints whether it's falling back to the legacy method.

### 2. Global vs Topic-Level Quartiles
The quartiles are calculated globally across all documents:
```python
y_q25 = np.nanpercentile(self.criterion, 25)
y_q75 = np.nanpercentile(self.criterion, 75)
```

However, when topics are formed, the mean values within topics might have much less variation than individual documents. This could mean that topic means rarely reach the extreme global quartiles.

**Debug Added**: The code now prints:
- Global quartile values for Y, HU, and AI
- Min/max ranges of topic means
- When a topic achieves n_high=3 or n_low=3

### 3. Color Distribution Tracking
**Debug Added**: The code now prints the final color distribution showing how many words got each color.

## Hypothesis

The most likely reason for no dark colors is that **topic means don't reach the global quartile thresholds**. When documents are clustered into topics, the averaging process tends to produce values closer to the center of the distribution, making it unlikely for a topic's mean to be in the extreme quartiles for all three measures simultaneously.

## Recommendations to Test

1. Run the word cloud generation with the debug output enabled to see:
   - Whether the legacy method is being used
   - What the global quartiles are
   - What the range of topic means is
   - The final color distribution

2. If topic means don't reach global quartiles, consider alternative approaches:
   - Use topic-specific quartiles instead of global quartiles
   - Use a different percentile threshold (e.g., 10th/90th instead of 25th/75th)
   - Use z-scores or other standardized measures
   - Calculate quartiles based on topic means rather than all documents

## Example Debug Output Expected

```
[DEBUG] Falling back to legacy color method. criterion=True, human_judgment=True, ai_judgment=True

[DEBUG] Global quartiles:
  Y:  q25=2.50, q75=3.50
  HU: q25=2.60, q75=3.40
  AI: q25=2.55, q75=3.45

[DEBUG] Topic mean ranges:
  Y:  min=2.80, max=3.20
  HU: min=2.85, max=3.15
  AI: min=2.82, max=3.18

[DEBUG] Color distribution for PC1:
  light_grey (#B0B0B0): 150 words
  light_red (#FF6B6B): 50 words
  light_blue (#6B9AFF): 45 words
```

This debug output would confirm if the topic means are compressed relative to the global distribution.
