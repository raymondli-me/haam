Implementation of the Double Machine Learning Lens Model Equation (DML-LME) for analyzing perceptual accuracy in high-dimensional settings. HAAM quantifies how humans and AI systems achieve accuracy when making judgments, decomposing their decision-making processes into interpretable components.

What is HAAM?
-------------

The **Human-AI Accuracy Model** addresses a fundamental question: When humans and AI achieve similar accuracy levels, are they using the same perceptual cues and cognitive strategies? 

HAAM provides a rigorous statistical framework to:

- Decompose judgment accuracy into direct and mediated pathways
- Quantify the **Percentage of Mediated Accuracy (PoMA)** for any perceiver
- Compare how humans vs AI utilize high-dimensional perceptual features
- Handle thousands of features using debiased machine learning
